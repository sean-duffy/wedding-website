          <h3>The Day After</h3>
          <p style="font-size: 1.2em;">
              The day after the wedding (Sunday 23rd of June) we'll be hosting a get together in the upstairs function room of 
              <a href='https://maps.app.goo.gl/tvsSyH2tQVknjUL66' target="_blank">The Ship and Mitre</a> on Dale Street from 12PM onwards.
              Please feel free to join us for some buffet food, a hair of the dog and/or some left over wedding cake (if there's any left)!
              Please note that this is only accessible via a set of stairs.
          </p>

          <h3>Hotels</h3>
          <p style="font-size: 1.2em;">
              We will be staying at <a href='https://www.municipalhotelliverpool.com/'>The Municipal Hotel</a> which is close to the reception venue.
              Please feel free to book in any city centre hotel, there is a wide variety to suit all budgets and tastes and the city is generally quite walkable.
              The ceremony and reception venues are within a 20 minute walk and there are plenty of taxis.
          </p>

          <h3>Gifts</h3>
          <p style="font-size: 1.2em;">
              We don't expect any gifts, however if you would like to contribute towards our honeymoon you can do so on the day or by using this <a href='https://monzo.me/sophiebuckley'>Monzo link</a>.
          </p>

          <h3>Outfit Information</h3>

              but spring and summer colours, florals and your Sunday best are encouraged! Fascinators, hats and hair accessories are welcome but by no means mandatory!
